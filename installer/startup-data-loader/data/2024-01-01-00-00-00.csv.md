# Sample CAN dataset

This markdown file preserves the synthetic CAN telemetry that previously shipped as `2024-01-01-00-00-00.csv`.
To exercise the pipeline locally, copy the code block below into a file named `2024-01-01-00-00-00.csv`
in the same directory before starting Docker Compose. The loader will detect and ingest any `.csv`
files placed in `/data`.

```csv
relative_ms,protocol,can_id,byte0,byte1,byte2,byte3,byte4,byte5,byte6,byte7
0,CAN,256,32,3,64,80,0,0,0,0
50,CAN,512,200,1,50,0,100,70,0,0
120,CAN,256,160,5,80,90,0,16,0,0
200,CAN,512,144,1,30,1,90,75,0,0
